Steve's first Pygame game - Flyover

The game will be about flying a fighter jet around and shooting down as many other planes as possible before you are shot down yourself or the time runs out. It will be top down 2D where the plane flies over a tiled map. Planes will have cannon shells, missiles and fuel that can be replenished at an airfield.
Controls will be to speed up and slow down (there's always constant forward motion), rotate and fire.

A large map will be generated and the camera will place the player at the center as they fly around the map looking for enemy planes.
